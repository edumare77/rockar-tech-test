Application built using Laravel 8 and vue.js 2. Data is stored in a MySql database, where tables Customers and Products have been created to store, retrieve and manipulate the data provided in the two csv files.

Besides Vue.js, Vue Router was installed to help routing between the views.

Composer has been installed as a dependency management. It allows us to declare the libraries the project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

It helps us installing/updating various requirements/components for our app such as Laravel framework, Doctrine, lodash etc..

Npm is also used to manage and install packages.

Laravel comes with PHPUnit, it has been used to create and run the tests. Run the command 'composer test' in order to use the tests.
